This software is currently in Alpha State.

It supports playback of multiple mp3 Files and is controllable over ArtNET (Network DMX).

The goal of this project is to provide a simple media player for small theaters that want to include the sound and music in their lightshow-cuelists.

The software does not need OLA but has a standalone ArtNET Receiver. The only dependency is `pygame`.

The reason I have chosen pygame is that I want this product to run on a raspberry pi.
